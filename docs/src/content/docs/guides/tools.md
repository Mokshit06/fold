Here is software supporting the FOLD format, built both within this project
and by other people:

- [FOLD viewer](https://edemaine.github.io/fold/examples/foldviewer.html)
  loads and display a given .fold file, useful for visualization and testing
- Amanda Ghassaei's
  [Origami Simulator](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/OrigamiSimulator)
  supports FOLD input and output
- Tomohiro Tachi's
  [Freeform Origami](http://origami.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tachi/software/#ffo)
  (simulator and design tool)
  supports FOLD input and output
- Robby Kraft's [Rabbit Ear](https://rabbitear.org/docs/)
  is based on FOLD. It includes a
  [file converter](https://convert.rabbitear.org/)
  (FOLD display, SVG import/export, and flat folding).
- [ORIPA](https://github.com/oripa/oripa): Origami Pattern Editor
